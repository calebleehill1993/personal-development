"For I am about to restore many things to the earth, pertaining to the priesthood, saith the Lord of Hosts."
- D&C 127:8

"Because of the Lord Jesus Christ, the priesthood, the scriptures, and words of living prophets have eternal significance. Restoration of priesthood authority is important because it is the power of the Lord. Scriptures are important because they contain the will of the Lord. Prophets and apostles are important because they teach and testify of the Lord."

"Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name. Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God."
- Helaman 3:27-28

"Study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its primary purpose - to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental. When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book - from its first chapter to the last - the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God. And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel. The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of the covenant."

"And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing."
- Moroni 10:30

"Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others. You developed some of these attributes premortally. Other you can develop here on earth as you persistently seek them."
- Russell M. Nelson
